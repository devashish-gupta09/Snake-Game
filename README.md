Snake Game in C++ using Data Structures

I attempted to recreate the famous Snake game, in which the player controls a snake-like line that grows in length, with the line serving as the primary barrier.
Snake has been around since the late 1970s, and if you owned a Nokia phone, you were definitely familiar with it. The cursor keys are used to manipulate a snake as it moves around the screen. Fruit is required for growth. You are not permitted to contact the exterior walls or your own body.  


->	Introduction:
The following is an example of a game written in C++ using Data Structures and is based on a game called ‘Snake’ which has been around since earliest days of home computing and has re-emerged in mobile phones during recent years.


->	Playing the Game:
The goal of the game is to collect as many stars (food) as possible while avoiding the obstacles (borders and the snake itself). Use the arrow keys to change the direction in which the snake travels. The snake grows longer as you collect food, increasing your chances of colliding with oneself. As you go on eating food, the speed with which the snake travels increase gradually. The length of the snake and the amount of food eaten determines your score. There is no such thing as a life. You only have one chance.
